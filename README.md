# Fernet-Encrypted-Ransomware-using-Python
A basic ransomware prototype built with python's Fernet symmetric encryption from the cryptography library. This project simulates ransomware behavior by encrypting files using a symmetric key and requiring the corresponding key for decryption, mimicking the functionality of real-world ransomware attacks. Used for educational purposes only.
